On Aug 14th, 2020, Benjamin Netanyahu, the current Prime Minister of Israel, has announced a peace deal with the Arab Gulf country, the United Arab Emirates. 
This deal has been reached with the help of the American President, Donald Trump.

## The cost - Netanyahu's base 
In exchange for peace, <span style="background: lightblue">the United Arab Emirated has demanded Netanyahu to drop his plans to annex lands in the West Bank</span>. <br />
Although more Israelis opposed annexing the West Bank than supported it, extreme right-wing politicians and voters in Israel didn't like the condition to peace, many of them voted for netanyahu last march. <br />
Opposition Knesset Member and former Minister of Defense, Naftali Bennet, said to Israeli media that this is a "one in a century opportunity being missed".

## Dubai and Tel Aviv have never been closer
To many Israelis, Dubai has always been a place that they have wished to visit. Dubai is an amazing tourist city, and it has the tallest tower in the world, the Burj Khalifa. <br />
Just like Israelis, the people of the UAE had managed to grow and build developed cities in the middle of the desert. <br />

## An accomplishment?
With that being said, this has been agreed while thousands are protesting against the current goverment in Israel. The Israeli Healthcare system had dealt with the virus so far, with around 700 deaths from the beggining of the pandemic, but the economy is at its worse with 1 million unemployed people (25%). Many say that the goverment has failed to deal with the pandemic, and this accomplishment may will cool down the toxic speech.
