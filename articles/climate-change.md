In my opinion, the Israeli weather is perfect. <br />
I really like the sun, so the Israeli summer is a great season for me: 100% of the summer days are sunny in my hot middle eastren country. <br />
The winter here is absolutely OK too. It's never snowing (However I go seeing snow every winter in mount Hermon), and many days are sunny as well. <br />
This has been the case for almost all of my living years, but the climate is changing.

## It's not just global warming

Climate change isn't just global warming. It leads to colder winters as well as hotter summers. It will also literally change the climate. On 10th August this year It was raining in Tel Aviv. Rain in the summer has never happened in Israel since the beggining of measurment in the 1950s. <br />
Climate change is already here.

## What can we do

Climate change is not that much of an issue: we are currely using the resources of 3 earthes, all we have to do is reduce it back to 1. the meat industry iresponsible for around 1 of those earthes, so cutting of meat would give us many more years to deal with the changing climate. <br />
However, asking all of the earth's population to be vegan is not realistic. The best solution is foodtech - developing an artificial meat that tastes and feels just like the original. Until that won't be solved, we can't really deal with climate change. Electric cars are also a more realistic solution than driving less, and we can come up with many more creative solutions like those.

### SavorEat

In the foodtech field, I would recommand you to check out this company. <br />
They developed a artificial meat that you can print on a special 3d printer and looks exactly like meat!
