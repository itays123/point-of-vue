On 2nd September, 2020, Israel had reported the highest number of new COVID-19 patients, with more than 2926 new cases. Number of deaths to reach 976 and total cases is at 123K.

## How did we get there?

By the middle of May, Israel had almost completely recovered from the Pandemic with only 10 new cases a day. A new goverment was just formed after 1.5 years with nobody managing to form a goverment and everything had seemed to be OK. <br />
Schools were reopened on 19th May, and this is where the problems began: number of cases rose again by the end of June. 

## The new schoolyear

Last Tuesday, on 1st September, the new schoolyear in Israel began. <br />
Many experts in the pandemic, including the Israeli COVID-19 czar Prof. Ronni Gamzu, had recommanded to not open schools in cities that are currently under outbreak and the goverment followed their advice, however the new schoolyear caused outbreaks in many new towns.

## The good news

The median age in Israel is 30.5 years, which means that the vast majority of COVID-19 patients aren't in serious contidions, with below 500 patients in hospitals.
